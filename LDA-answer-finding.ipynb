      "Abstract:  Decision making in medicine is informed by a subtle mixture of factors: education, experience, local protocols, gut feeling, avoiding litigation. The principle of audit is that one can influence practice also by reflecting back personal performance measured against standardised averages or formal guidance. Mitchell and colleagues highlight some of the challenges herein in their analysis of computed tomography in acute presentations with epilepsy. 1 They develop the findings of a recent national audit in the UK in selected cohorts of such patients which identified that as many as one in five patients with known epilepsy had scans following presentation to the emergency department. Many of you reading this are involved with such acute medicine presentations. They present a population level analysis over a 3-year period to identify patient factors associated with the rate of scanning. The potential of this to influence management algorithms and practice is discussed elegantly. The theme of developing local policy by using national datasuch as the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) -is developed in the paper by Soong et al . 2 Frailty is a common condition with a potentially significant health impact among older adults. To date, it is not known whether stratifying by degrees of frailty can help plan care and result in improved outcomes. In a retrospective observational study, the authors report the predictive ability of routinely coded 'frailty syndromes' to predict long length of stay and mortality in a 1-year sample of patients over the age of 65. Frailty is of relevance to generalists, given the previous finding by the same group that the majority of hospital admission patients have at least one of these frailty syndromes. Clinical Medicine is proudly a journal of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), and is delighted to showcase topics that are of interest to the RCP. One of these is the need for NHS-based tobacco addiction services, as highlighted in the RCP report Hiding in plain sight: Treating tobacco dependency in the NHS which called for a new model of care providing 'opt-out' specialist services to treat the condition. 3 Evison and colleagues from Manchester report on the CURE project, the first UK service modelled on the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation. 4 A feature of the model is that secondary care clinicians are at the frontline in the delivery of treatment, of especial importance since the NHS 10-year plan commits to funding the treatment of Think national, act local: the role of the physician and the RCP tobacco addiction in hospitals. The CURE project provides a potential framework for national roll out of such services, and we are delighted to present the impact of the study in the first 6 months of service. Another national, indeed global, health crisis -much more acute -is the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) . The RCP, and its journals, are able to respond in nimble fashion with an update on the evolving outbreak, its clinical manifestations and the priorities for the immediate future. Alex Lake, one of the journal's associate editors has provided an excellent overview highlighting principles that physicians should consider. 5 In this rapidly evolving scenario, the latest advice page remains an essential resource: www.gov.uk/government/ collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus As ever, alongside these reviews and original submissions we have our regular CME section (this month, on renal medicine curated by our outstanding demitting nephrology associate editor, Mike Almond) as well as our insight-provoking clinical cases and lessons of the month. And we feature another of our popular Opinion pieces -this time on training in clinical examination. 6 We hope you find plenty of content to enjoy and share. ■ References 1 Mitchell JW , Kallis C , Dixon PA , Grainger R , Marson AG .

      "Title:  Minimising prescribing errors in the ICU DJ Melia, S Saha Queen' s Hospital, Romford, UK Critical Care\n",
      "Abstract:  We aimed to audit the prescribing practice on a busy 14-bedd general ICU, and develop standardised practices and tools to improve safety. Prescribing errors occur as commonly as in 10% of UK hospital admissions, costing 8.5 extra bed days per admission, and costing the National Health Service an estimated £1 billion per annum [1]. The majority of these mistakes are avoidable [2]. Methods We audited the daily infusion charts of all patients in three separate spot checks, over 1 week. We assessed all aspects of prescriptions that make them legal and valid, in accordance with national guidance [3]. New procedures were introduced, which included a standardised prescription sticker, with common, preprinted, infusion prescriptions on (noradrenaline, propofol, and so forth), and education on using the new prescription stickers. A month later the audit process was repeated. We assessed 129 prescriptions in the fi rst round, and 111 after intervention, demonstrating a 70% improvement in safe prescribing. Only 24% of prescriptions initially fulfi lled best practice criteria, improving to 94% afterwards. We also reduced the number of infusions running without prescription, 7 (6%) versus 24 (19%). See Figures 1 and 2 . Conclusion Our audit supports the need for standardised prescribing practices within critical care, especially when dealing with potentially harmful vasoactive/sedative drugs. With a small, cost-eff ective intervention (£20 for 6,200 stickers), we improved prescribing accuracy, and thus patient safety in intensive care. P2 Results Mock thefts were successfully accomplished on six occasions over a 4-week period. On each occasion the Limpet photographed the 'thief' and recorded the date and time of access. Therefore, in the event of a real theft it would be possible to quickly and easily indentify the culprit. Conclusion When CDs are missing it can be extremely stressful for the staff involved. Those who have access to CDs may feel unfairly scrutinised and the potential for false accusation exists. Investigating the theft of CDs is costly and usually involves pharmacists, managers and the police. Until the issue is resolved, potential suspects are usually suspended from work, leading to disruptions in patient care. The utility of the Limpet in modifying staff behaviour by reducing the number of occasions and the duration of time that open drug cupboards are left unattended, has previously been demonstrated [1]. By providing the facility to determine exactly who accessed each CD cupboard at which time, this initial study has shown the benefi ts of the Limpet as a tool for detecting theft. Therefore the installation of the Limpet mitigates the diffi culties of investigating CD theft and is likely to prove an eff ective deterrent. Reference 1.

      "Title:  Congenital Malaria in China\n",
      "Abstract:  Background: Congenital malaria, in which infants are directly infected with malaria parasites from their mother prior to or during birth, is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs at relatively low rates in malariaendemic regions. It is recognized as a serious problem in Plasmodium falciparum-endemic sub-Saharan Africa, where recent data suggests that it is more common than previously believed. In such regions where malaria transmission is high, neonates may be protected from disease caused by congenital malaria through the transfer of maternal antibodies against the parasite. However, in low P. vivax-endemic regions, immunity to vivax malaria is low; thus, there is the likelihood that congenital vivax malaria poses a more significant threat to newborn health. Malaria had previously been a major parasitic disease in China, and congenital malaria case reports in Chinese offer valuable information for understanding the risks posed by congenital malaria to neonatal health. As most of the literature documenting congenital malaria cases in China are written in Chinese and therefore are not easily accessible to the global malaria research community, we have undertaken an extensive review of the Chinese literature on this subject. Here, we reviewed congenital malaria cases from three major searchable Chinese journal databases, concentrating on data from 1915 through 2011. Following extensive screening, a total of 104 cases of congenital malaria were identified. These cases were distributed mainly in the eastern, central, and southern regions of China, as well as in the low-lying region of southwest China. The dominant species was P. vivax (92.50%), reflecting the malaria parasite species distribution in China. The leading clinical presentation was fever, and other clinical presentations were anaemia, jaundice, paleness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and general weakness. With the exception of two cases, all patients were cured with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, quinine, artemether, and artesunate. The symptoms of congenital malaria vary significantly between cases, so clear and early diagnosis is difficult. We suggest that active surveillance might be necessary for neonates born to mothers with a history of malaria.\n",

      "Title:  Animal assisted intervention: A systematic review of benefits and risks\n",
      "Abstract:  The therapeutic use of animals has been debated for decades, and its use explored in a variety of settings and populations. However, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions. Evidence based knowledge is essential to implement effective strategies in hospital. This review focused on the use of animal programs for hospitalized patients, and considered the potential risks. Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, PsychInfo, Ebsco Animals, PROQUEST, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE, and PRISMA guidelines were adhered to. Results: Out of 432 articles were identified 36 articles suitable for inclusion into the review. Data was heterogeneous in terms of age of patient, health issue, animals used and the length of interactions, which made comparison problematic. Studies on children, psychiatric and elderly patients were the most common. The animal-intervention programs suggested various benefits such as reducing stress, pain and anxiety. Other outcomes considered were changes in vital signs, and nutritional intake. Most studies used dogs, but other animals were effectively employed. The major risks outlined were allergies, infections and animal-related accidents. Zoonosis was a possible risk, as well as common infections as Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus Aureus. The implementation of simple hygiene protocols was effective at minimizing risk. The literature suggested that the benefits outweighed by far the risks. Conclusion: The human relationship with animals can be useful and relatively safe for inpatients with various problems. Moreover, the implementation of security precautions and the careful selection of patients should minimize the risks, particularly those infection-related. Many aspects remain unclear, further studies are required.\n",

      "Abstract:  Prevention of serious infections in pregnant mothers, newborns, and young infants through immunization during pregnancy and in early life has the potential to further reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, research in this field has advanced substantially, from the understanding of the biology and immunology of pregnancy and early life, to the active development of several candidate vaccines, for which challenges and opportunities for global implementation are under consideration. Experts from academia, industry, regulatory and funding agencies, public health, and international organizations met in Brussels (Belgium) from 10 to 12 September 2017, at the 4th International Neonatal and Maternal Immunization Symposium (INMIS), to review the most relevant advances in maternal and neonatal immunization. The overarching focus of the conference was to identify the path forward to achieve integration of maternal and early life immunization strategies for the successful implementation of vaccines in antenatal care and pediatric programs for reduction of maternal and infant mortality worldwide. IMPORTANCE This report provides an overview of the proceedings of the 4th International Maternal and Neonatal Immunization Symposium, where presentations focused on the state-of-the-art research on the development and implementation of vaccines given during pregnancy for the protection of mothers and infants.\n"

      "Abstract:  Background: Respiratory tract infections are common in the context of the Hajj pilgrimage and respiratory pathogens can be transmitted via contact with contaminated surfaces. We sampled surfaces during the Hajj to detect the presence of respiratory bacteria and viruses. Methods: Frequently touched surfaces at Mecca, Mina, Arafat and Medina were sampled. The common respiratory pathogens were tested by qPCR. Results: 70/142 (49.3%) environmental samples collected were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Among the positive samples, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the bacterium most frequently tested positive (57.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.1%). 32.9% positive samples tested positive for rhinovirus and 1.4% for coronavirus. Surfaces with the highest rates of positive samples were kitchen tables (100%), water fountain faucet (73.3%) and edge of water coolers lid (84.6%). Samples collected in Mina were the most frequently contaminated with 68.8% being positive for at least one pathogen and 18.8% positive for a combination of multiple pathogens. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that respiratory pathogens are common in environmental surfaces from areas frequented by Hajj pilgrims. Further larger-scale studies are needed to better assess the possible role of environmental respiratory pathogens in respiratory infections in Hajj pilgrims.\n",

      "Abstract:  Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified human parvovirus. HBoV is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in children. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of HBoV in populations in the Caribbean. Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, 287 blood samples were collected from pediatric patients and tested for the presence of HBoV-specific antibody using a virus-likeparticle based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: HBoV-specific antibodies were found to be present in 220/287 (76.7%) of samples collected from the pediatric population. Seroprevalence of HBoV was highest in those $2 years old. The seroepidemiological profile suggests that most children are exposed to HBoV during the first two years of life in Jamaica. Conclusion: HBoV infection is common in children in Jamaica. HBoV seroprevalence rates in the Caribbean are similar to those previously reported in other areas of the world.\n",

      "Abstract:  In Ré union Island, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1996 by the sentinel general practitioner's network, little is known about the etiology of Influenza like-illness (ILI) that differs from influenza viruses in a tropical area. We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Ré union Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI.\n",

      "Abstract:  Households are high-intensity close-contact environments favorable for transmission of respiratory viruses, yet little is known for low-income settings. Methods. Active surveillance was completed on 47 households in rural coastal Kenya over 6 months during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were taken from 483 household members twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. Using molecular diagnostics, NPSs from 6 households were screened for 15 respiratory viruses and the remainder of households only for the most frequent viruses observed: rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV; comprising strains 229E, OC43, and NL63), adenovirus (AdV), and RSV (A and B). Results. Of 16 928 NPSs tested for the common viruses, 4259 (25.2%) were positive for ≥1 target; 596 (13.8%) had coinfections. Detection frequencies were 10.5% RV (1780), 7.5% HCoV (1274), 7.3% AdV (1232), and 3.2% RSV (537). On average, each household and individual had 6 and 3 different viruses detected over the study period, respectively. Rhinovirus and HCoV were detected in all the 47 households while AdV and RSV were detected in 45 (95.7%) and 40 (85.1%) households, respectively. The individual risk of infection over the 6-month period was 93.4%, 80.1%, 71.6%, 61.5%, and 37.1% for any virus, RV, HCoV, AdV, and RSV, respectively. NPSs collected during symptomatic days and from younger age groups had higher prevalence of virus detection relative to respective counterparts. RSV was underrepresented in households relative to hospital admission data. Conclusions. In this household setting, respiratory virus infections and associated illness are ubiquitous. Future studies should address the health and economic implications of these observations.\n"

      "Abstract:  Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was first officially reported in Africa in 2006; thereafter this virus has spread rapidly from Nigeria to 11 other African countries. This study was aimed at utilizing data from confirmed laboratory reports to carry out a qualitative evaluation of the factors responsible for HPAI H5N1 persistence in Africa and the public health implications; and to suggest appropriate control measures. Relevant publications were sought from data banks and repositories of FAO, OIE, WHO, and Google scholars. Substantiated data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Africa and in humans across the world were mined. HPAI H5N1 affects poultry and human populations, with Egypt having highest human cases (346) globally. Nigeria had a reinfection from 2014 to 2015, with outbreaks in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso throughout 2016 unabated. The persistence of this virus in Africa is attributed to the survivability of HPAIV, ability to evolve other subtypes through genetic reassortment, poor biosecurity compliance at the live bird markets and poultry farms, husbandry methods and multispecies livestock farming, poultry vaccinations, and continuous shedding of HPAIV, transboundary transmission of HPAIV through poultry trades; and transcontinental migratory birds. There is, therefore, the need for African nations to realistically reassess their status, through regular surveillance and be transparent with HPAI H5N1 outbreak data. Also, it is important to have an understanding of HPAIV migration dynamics which will be helpful in epidemiological modeling, disease prevention, control and eradication measures.\n",

      "Abstract:  Bat-borne viruses can pose a serious threat to human health, with examples including Nipah virus (NiV) in Bangladesh and Malaysia, and Marburg virus (MARV) in Africa. To date, significant human outbreaks of such viruses have not been reported in the European Union (EU). However, EU countries have strong historical links with many of the countries where NiV and MARV are present and a corresponding high volume of commercial trade and human travel, which poses a potential risk of introduction of these viruses into the EU. In assessing the risks of introduction of these bat-borne zoonotic viruses to the EU, it is important to consider the location and range of bat species known to be susceptible to infection, together with the virus prevalence, seasonality of viral pulses, duration of infection and titre of virus in different bat tissues. In this paper, we review the current scientific knowledge of all these factors, in relation to the introduction of NiV and MARV into the EU.\n",

      "Abstract:  Bats are natural reservoirs of the largest proportion of viral zoonoses among mammals, thus understanding the conditions for pathogen persistence in bats is essential to reduce human risk. Miniopterus schreibersii bat species in Catalonia. We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.\n"
